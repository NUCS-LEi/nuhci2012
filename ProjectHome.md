**Problem:** Adequate and appropriate sleep is considered as one of the important factors in a healthy life. But, most of people don’t know how they could manage or improve the quality of their sleep or what are the significant parameters affect the quality of their sleep. These kind of information and details would be useful not only for the people with sleep disorders, but also for the people who wants to improve their sleep quality. Although, few mobile applications try to track users’ sleep and give a brief feedback on that, the available applications don’t help users to manage and improve their sleep. There are not enough technological works in terms of designing appropriate devices or application interfaces to support better sleep yet.

Designing an application for smart phone and using phones’ sensor and some external sensors, we aim to address the shortages in the sleep tracking such that enables users to recognize their own sleep characteristics and the parameters influence that. These individual data classified and a simply analyzed to give the user some hints to make her/his sleep better. As important design considerations of the application are being “really easy to use” and “unobtrusiveness” for all users specifically older adults who found new technologies complicated and far beyond their abilities to learn and use.

**Target User:** All the people who want to improve the quality of their sleep or who have sleep disorders can benefit from the app but the app is designed especially for older adults focusing on their needs and their abilities to use the application

**Solution:** Our goal is to build Good-Sleep an application on Android cellphones (or tablets) to help users manage their own sleep behavior and modify it towards a healthier lifestyle as much as possible. The application gathers data from sensors (implemented in cellphones and some other wearable wireless sensors) and from user (who answers to some questions, defines some flags), does a simple processing on the collected data and provides feedback to users based on them. Users can also see a summary report on their sleep behavior by day/week/month. Good-Sleep helps users to find answers to questions such as: “How was my sleep (length of sleep, quality of sleep, and wake up times during sleep)? How well is my sleep? When during the last week/ month I have the best sleep? What did / didn’t I do on the day that I had the best sleep? What should I do to improve my sleep style?” In addition, the application helps the user to define some goals for a better sleep and define reminders to achieve those goals (For example going to bed at a same time every night).

**Future Goals:** We’d like to measure the effect of some environment parameters (light, temperature, noise) on the quality of sleep. Comparing the accuracy of collected data, we’d like to see the importance of using wearable sensors and/or using sensors in the pillow/bed of the user in addition to using only phone’s sensors.
